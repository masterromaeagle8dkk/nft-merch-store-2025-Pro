## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a platform like **nft-merch-store** would integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

First, it's crucial to clarify the core premise. An NFT merch store's primary function is to mint and sell NFT-gated merchandise (e.g., a hoodie that only an NFT holder can purchase). Direct, high-frequency automated trading isn't its main goal.
